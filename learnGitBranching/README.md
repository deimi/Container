# learnGitBranching container

A little docker container for running a local instance of learnGitBranching (https://learngitbranching.js.org/). \
Very useful for offline learning without internet connection (e.g. in planes)


If the container is running you can call localhost:12345 in you browser.

## Starting
Use plain docker commands or script to start container.


Call script with argument: \
    install   ... creates learnGitBranching container \
    start     ... start container \
    stop      ... stop container \
    uninstall ... removes container and image
