# explain-git container

A little docker container for running a local instance of explain-git (http://onlywei.github.io/explain-git-with-d3/). \
Very useful for offline learning without internet connection (e.g. in planes)


If the container is running you can call localhost:12347 in you browser.

## Starting
Use plain docker commands or script to start container.


Call script with argument: \
    install   ... creates explain-git container \
    start     ... start container \
    stop      ... stop container \
    uninstall ... removes container and image
